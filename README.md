MultiplicationTable
===================

Prints out multiplication table of the first 10 prime numbers.

Notes
- This runs in O(n^2) time.  There are other alogorithms that could get the nprimes function to run faster, but to
multiply each number by each other number will still be O(n^2).
- I have included the case where we have n prime numbers.
- tests included in the tc_multiplier file
